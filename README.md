Almost every keyboard nowadays uses the QWERTY layout (named after the first 6 characters of the first row), but what about other layouts?
Dvorak is an alternate keyboard layout that keeps the most commonly used characters in the home row (2nd) so that the typist's fingers don't have to switch positions as much.

Flip the switch on the BeyondQWERTY site to type in Dvorak while using a QWERTY keyboard.
